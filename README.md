How to use:

1. Context Menu:

Run the main exe as administrator once. This will create 2 context menu items. Encrypt and Decrypt.
When right clicking on a file, you can select encrypt and provide a password.
When decrypting that file, the same password must be used as was used for encryption.

2. CLI:

&lt;executable path&gt; &lt;input file path&gt; &lt;e || d&gt;

File must have extension .encr to use d (decrypt)
File cannot have extension .encr to use e (encrypt)
